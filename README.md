# Instructions

If you haven't already, make sure you have [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) downloaded. The site has a downloads button at the top, of which you'll want MinGW/Base/gcc. I am using the Version 4 branch (4.7.1 to be exact), however, you are free to use the Version 5 branch. If so, your mileage may vary. The the amount of options there is daunting, however, they do have a [easy to use installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download) to help make things easier.

Once you're set up, you'll want to open up the build.bat file and change the directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin\" to your MinGW directory. I don't know why I still have CodeBlocks on my computer (Visual Studio and 4coder are my main IDEs), but it had MinGW all set up and ready to go. Can't complain there.

After that's done, main.c will be compiled to WaterBuckets.exe. Run that and enjoy the simulation.
